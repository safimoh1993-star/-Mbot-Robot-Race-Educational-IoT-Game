# 🤖 Mbot Robot Race – Educational IoT Game

An interactive educational game designed and implemented by **Safia Mohammed Al-Qarni**.  

Two **Mbot robots compete along a track** by solving questions displayed on **iPads linked to the robots**. The project promotes coding, problem-solving, and STEM learning in a fun and competitive way.  

🎯 *The game was highly appreciated and requested for a showcase at the Saudi Communications and Space Authority event!* 💚
